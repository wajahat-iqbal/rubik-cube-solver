Hold cube as the white center phase is in
|     front of you red center is at your left
|       Orange center is at youe right
|         green  center is at top
|       blue   center  is at bottom
|     Yellow side is opposit  to wite center        
        
0 is the White center of your cube is front phase you have to enter it first start entring from left-top element
   Than enter from red center 
   Than Orange 
   Than Green
